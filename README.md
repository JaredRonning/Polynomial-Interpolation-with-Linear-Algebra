# Polynomial-interpolation-with-linear-algebra
**Warning**: this repo may contain bad code. Written in school while I was just messing around

This project uses linear algebra to interpolate a polynomial given a set of nodes. It also gives the error using the infinity norm and allows for iterative improvement of the solution. Programming done in MATLAB.
